Detailed Report
16.04.2023

Pursuing knowledge and academic excellence as a PhD student is fundamental to my personal and professional growth. In this report, I will outline the results of my study programme and research project work, which serves as a comprehensive overview of my academic achievements and contributions to date. I have developed a broad understanding of my field of study's theoretical and practical applications through attending courses, lectures, dialogues, and academic events. Furthermore, through various academic contributions, such as conferences, assignments, and presentations, I have engaged with the wider academic community, shared my research, and received feedback from my peers and mentors. Overall, this report serves as a personal assessment of my progress and academic achievements since my arrival in Germany, demonstrating my commitment to pursuing knowledge and contributing to the academic discourse of my field.

Since I arrived in Germany, the contact with my Doktorvater, Jörg Schröder, could not have been better. The time and constancy he shows during our meetings are to be admired. We have had discussions on a bi-weekly basis to discuss progress and optimally steer the research. If it were not for the support of my supervisor, the research would not be of the quality it is at the moment.

The first stage during my time in Germany focused a lot on improving the methodology and the content of the study, as well as the deepening of the state of the art and the theoretical framework. Here I have to thank PhD Federica Scaffindi, a researcher at the Leibniz University of Hannover, for her invitations to workshops and support in the methodological part of my research. The methodology was utterly rewritten and reformulated for an optimal fit for my research.

The second stage focus of the investigation during my stay in Germany explores the use of mapping, scenario planning, and scenario building as tools to deepen the understanding of the potential future states of the urban fabric. Urban design is constantly evolving, with innovative ideas and approaches always emerging. Scenario mapping involves creating multiple possible future representations to inform urban planning decisions, ensuring flexible and adaptable plans, and considering various outcomes. The work of Christian Salewski has been fascinating in the evolution of scenario mapping, from its creation for military purposes to its current context and issues, such as rising sea levels and climate change. This technique has been developed by many experts in the field, including Salewski, Christiaanse, and Gehl, whose contributions have been invaluable. In this brief paragraph, we will explore the work of these three experts and their impact on scenario mapping in urban design. Salewski is an acclaimed architect and urban planner who has dedicated much of his career to researching scenario-making in the Netherlands. Kees Christiaanse, another prominent figure in the field, has significantly contributed to scenario mapping through his work at KCAP Architects and Planners and as a professor of architecture and urban design at ETH Zurich. His involvement in large-scale urban projects, such as the Randstad 2040 study and the Hamburg HafenCity master plan, has allowed him to explore different scenarios for the future of cities in innovative ways. Jan Gehl, a pioneering Danish architect and urban design consultant, has developed various methods and tools for improving the quality of urban life. His human-centred approach to urban planning has been influential, and his books on urban design have profoundly impacted the field. The Public Spaces Public Life surveys, which he developed, have been essential as they document how people use public spaces in different scenarios.

In conclusion, the contributions of Salewski, Christiaanse, and Gehl to scenario mapping in the urban design must be considered. Their innovative approaches and dedication to improving the quality of urban life have significantly impacted the field. As urban areas grow and evolve, scenario mapping will undoubtedly become an increasingly important tool for envisioning alternative futures and shaping cities.

The following section explores a critical component of my doctoral thesis, which investigated the processes of slum upgrading and slum eradication through three case studies for Latin America. The goal is to determine which approach best suits the specific circumstances of the Isla Trinitaria, a precarious urban complexity, in Guayaquil. The three case studies I examined are Brazil, Chile, and Colombia. For each case study, I explored the relevant laws, policies, and projects and the social, economic, and political perspectives that shaped them. The aim was to gain a detailed understanding of the processes involved in providing housing for the most vulnerable members of society and to identify the best tools for shaping urban design.

The exploration of slum upgrading and slum eradication processes is a critical topic for urban design and development. Examining case studies from Brazil, Chile, and Colombia shows that slum upgrading is more beneficial than slum eradication in providing adequate housing for vulnerable city residents. Slum upgrading aims to improve the living conditions of residents in informal settlements by upgrading and formalising the existing infrastructure, providing essential services, and building new housing units. In contrast, slum eradication focuses on removing informal settlements and relocating residents to other areas, which can cause social, economic, and political problems. The case studies demonstrate that slum upgrading projects can positively impact urban development's social, economic, and political dimensions. By providing affordable and secure housing, slum upgrading can help to reduce poverty and inequality, improve health outcomes, and promote social integration.
Moreover, slum upgrading can catalyse economic development, stimulating local business growth and creating new jobs. Therefore, urban planners, policymakers, and developers must recognise the importance of slum upgrading in promoting sustainable and equitable urban development. By adopting a holistic approach that involves the participation of local communities and stakeholders, slum upgrading projects can be tailored to each context's specific needs and priorities. Ultimately, slum upgrading aims to create livable, safe, and vibrant neighbourhoods that contribute to the overall well-being of urban residents.

The following section is structured in three parts: The first part focuses on the conferences I have attended since I arrived in Germany. I have had the opportunity to participate in various conferences that have been of great help to my research, either to broaden my knowledge or to create and strengthen my network of contacts. Among the conferences I have had the honour of participating in was the Research Symposium Territorial Innovation, an international symposium held at the University of Hannover, where I was a speaker in the PhD student section. I was also a speaker at the Architecture of the Territories conference in Hannover, where I was lucky enough to present my research project to authorities and colleagues I admire. In addition, in January this year, I was invited to a colloquium with the visit of Prof. Dr Angélica Benatti Alvim, Director of the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism at Mackenzie University (São Paulo, Brazil). My investigation addresses several topics related to Prof. Dr Angélica Benatti Alvim's long research career. As a result, she invited me to pursue a double PhD degree programme at Mackenzie in the framework of the dual degree agreement between Leibniz University Hannover and Mackenzie University for the PhD program. My Doktorvater supports the idea very much, and we look forward to conducting a stay time in Brazil of a minimum of six months to make the dual degree possible. We had a video conference with the DAAD on 11.03.2023 to discuss the topic, and they were very supportive. I am pleased about this new possibility for my PhD, thanks to the DAAD, Prof. Dr Angélica Benatti Alvim, Prof. Jörg Schröder, Leibniz University and Mackenzie University.

While trying to immerse myself in the Ecuadorian research context, I had a remarkable opportunity. I connected with Professor and Research Director, Prof. Dr Andrés Velástegui of the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral (ESPOL), who organised a conference during my stay in Ecuador so I could present my work. The conference had an international scope, with researchers from Ecuador, Brazil, and myself, if I may say so, representing Germany. This unique and enriching opportunity allowed me to foster the creation of a network of contacts more closely aligned with my field of study. Prof. Dr Andrés Velástegui was extraordinarily gracious, supported my research, and proposed future academic publications.

I have had the good fortune of attending two highly engaging workshops centred on practices and techniques in academic research. The workshops, namely "Open Research: Abstract in Architecture" and "Open Research: Empirical Methodology," provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the various facets of research in architecture and urbanism.
The first workshop, "Open Research: Abstract in Architecture," primarily focused on developing abstracts for research projects in architecture and urbanism. The workshop emphasised best practices for effectively communicating research findings to others, ensuring that abstracts convey the core objectives and conclusions of research projects with precision and clarity. It provided an in-depth analysis of the importance of abstracts in research, highlighting their significance in framing research questions and objectives and as a tool for structuring research projects. The second workshop, "Open Research: Empirical Methodology," delved into the various methodologies and practices employed in conducting empirical research in architecture and urbanism. The workshop explored a range of approaches, such as case studies, surveys, and interviews, providing participants with valuable insights into the advantages and limitations of each method. Furthermore, it highlighted ethical considerations related to empirical research, such as informed consent and confidentiality, enabling participants to conduct high-quality research with due respect to the rights of research participants.

Since being in Germany, the third part of my research focuses on using courses to explore innovative tools to facilitate and improve the quality of my doctoral thesis. I have explored tools that are both foreign to the area of urban design by traditional methods but even more critical in the growing role of technology, the emerging and inevitable growth of AI and its role in our role as researchers, as well as more traditional methods to my research area, to broaden my knowledge and use the best tools to achieve my goals. In summary, these experiences have been fundamental for my growth and development as a researcher, and I plan to continue attending conferences, workshops and courses to continue improving my work. I have been able to learn from these experiences. However, they all contribute enormously to better handling of mapping, cartography, data analysis and explorations with technological support to deepen and revalidate concepts in the context of this research. 

I have taken two practical and theoretical subjects at the University of Hannover. My attendance was during the whole semester but not for the final projects. On the one hand, GIS and the City explore GIS concepts with the program QGIS, explaining tools and handling geographic data with the help of QGIS. On the other hand, Maps in Motion uses exploratory tools for creating and visualising maps or data with a visual impact. Tools such as QGIS and Adobe After Effects were explored, and I added Blender, an open-access 3D modelling and rendering program, to the mix.

In addition to the courses offered by the university, I have delved deeper into the realm of data science, data analysis, data processing, and mapping using Qgis, Python, and compatible libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, GeoPandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and also tools that explore machine learning and deep learning, such as Python, Tensorflow and Keras. I have constantly turned to courses on the online learning platform under the domain of www.Udemy.com. Udemy stands out as a leading online learning platform that provides individuals from all backgrounds with new tools to develop skills. I have personally attended the following courses on this platform with outstanding results that have significantly aided my research: "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr Angela Yu, "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" by Jose Portilla, "Tensorflow 2.0: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence" by the lazy programmer, "Map Academy: get mapping quickly, with QGIS" by Alasdair Rae, and "3D mapping with Aerialod" by Alasdair Rae.

The following section of this document details the field research time conducted in Ecuador in February of this year. One of the critical aspects of urbanism research is fieldwork, which involves conducting research in urban areas to gather data, interact with local communities, and understand the city's physical, social, and cultural aspects. Field research is fundamental in urban design, as it allows researchers to understand the urban environment, its challenges, and its opportunities. This itinerary for a PhD research trip to Guayaquil, Ecuador, highlights the importance of field research in urbanism, as it involves visits to historical sites, natural reserves, and urban areas, as well as meetings with local engineers, organisations, and other PhD students. Through this field research, I have gathered valuable data and insights that will contribute to their research while engaging with local communities and contributing to the knowledge of urbanism in delta cities.
This comprehensive itinerary presents a 28-day journey through the vibrant city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, focusing on historical, cultural, and environmental research. The journey begins with exploring the city's rich history, including visits to landmarks such as the Guayaquil Historical Centre, Estero Salado, and Las Peñas. The itinerary includes a dialogue with an engineer in the sustainable forestry sector and an interview with the Hogar de Cristo, an organisation about environmental conservation projects.

Throughout the journey, free days for rest and independent city exploration allow for a well-rounded and enriching experience. This itinerary offered a unique opportunity for my investigation to delve deeper into the context of Guayaquil's culture, history, and environment and gain new insights into their respective fields of study.

Days 1-6 involve exploring the city's rich history, including visits to landmarks such as the Guayaquil Historical Centre, Estero Salado, and Las Peñas. Day 6 features a dialogue with engineer Caio Neves in the sustainable forestry sector. Days 7-12 and 16-18 involve revisiting historical archives for research purposes; day 11 includes an interview with the Hogar de Cristo, an organisation for slum upgrading, and Days 19-20 involve dialogues with the PhD. Ing. Andrés Velastegui Montoya. Days 15 and 21-25 include a conference and research exchange with PhD students from ESPOL University and Brazil, organised by PhD. Ing. Andrés Velastegui Montoya. The itinerary concludes with a final visit to the historical archives of Guayaquil to finalise the field research.

Overall, this carefully crafted itinerary provided a unique experience for understanding the urban and social structure in the city. Through visits to historical sites and natural reserves, dialogues with experts, and research exchange with fellow researchers, my investigation will surely gain invaluable insights and develop meaningful, deeper understanding and input from the exchange.
